# Time Range Problem v1

## Assumptions

- Allowed to use external libraries (ie. npm libs)
- Time range data is input as objects with fields "start" and "end"
- Time range data is unsorted
- O(n^2) time (could potentially be O(nlogn) if a sorting algorithm is used to sort the ranges first. Then v2 function could be used.)
